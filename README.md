# 🥐☕️🍽 Custom Food 🥪🍷🍰
### What is Custom Food?
- it is a web application
- made for event organizers, hosts, or anyone who organizes an event where meals are served (eg. birthday parties, weddings, gallery vernissage, etc.)
- you can involve caterers
- the goal of this application: the app helps organizers and hosts to know in advance of the event their guests food restrictions. Thus, makes it possible that every guest can find the meal she/he can consume. So everyone is happy! 🎉
- the app can list multiple events. You can create a new event any time you want. Each event shows a chart with all the food restricions + and a list of guests, which makes it possible to add or delete guests.
- the app has an email sending possibility, a confirmation, a login-logout, a password verification, an automatic chart generator, a pdf creator, a list of checkboxes (for the food restrictions), and many more features.
- the app is built with Ruby on Rails, HTML5 and contains some SCSS + JS.
